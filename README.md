*A no-BS Vim cheat sheet + personal survival log*

So I decided to learn Vim.  
Not because I was feeling productive â€” but because I was tired of feeling like the only dev who still used the mouse.

At first? I thought it was a dumb terminal relic streamers like ThePrimeagen used just to flex.  
Then I gave it a shotâ€¦.

## The Journey

After some painful key smashes and a lot of patience, I started to see the point:
- Modal editing isnâ€™t broken â€” itâ€™s intentional
- Mouse-free = flow-state mode
- Speed comes from **muscle memory**, not magic

Iâ€™m not a Vim master (yet), but Iâ€™m seeing the light.
